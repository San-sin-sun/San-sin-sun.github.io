# Differences between QFT and QM
**1. Theoretical Framework and Scope**
  - **QM**
    - **Scope**：Primarily used to study the behavior of microscopic particles such as electrons, protons, and atoms.
    - **Objects of Description**：Individual particles' motion, energy, wave functions, etc.
    - **Fundamental Principles**：Based on Schrödinger's equation, the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function, and the uncertainty principle.
  - **QFT**
    - **Scope**： Used to describe interactions between particles, especially in high-energy physics, addressing fundamental particles and forces.
    - **Objects of Description**：The relationship between fields and particles, where particles are seen as excitations of the underlying fields.
    - **Fundamental Principles**Based on the quantization of fields, covering electromagnetic fields, strong interactions, weak interactions, etc.

**2. Mathematical Tools and Methods**
  - **QM**
    - Uses wave functions (or state vectors) to describe particle states.
    - Employs Schrödinger's equation or Heisenberg's matrix mechanics to describe the evolution of particles.
  - **QFT**
    - Utilizes field operators($\Psi(\boldsymbol{r})$) to describe the quantum states of fields.
    - Applies Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, and path integrals to describe the evolution and interactions of fields.

**3. Concept of Particles and Fields**
  - **QM**
    - Particles are described by the probability density of wave functions, exhibiting wave-particle duality.
    - Focuses on the motion, energy states, and evolution of particles' wave functions.
  - **QFT**
    - Particles are described as excitations of quantum fields, e.g., the electron field's quantum excitations are electrons.
    - Emphasizes the quantization of fields, where different types of fields correspond to different particles.

**4. Relativity**
  - **QM**
    - Generally deals with non-relativistic cases, where particles' velocities are much less than the speed of light.
    - Relativistic quantum mechanics (like the Dirac equation) is an extension but does not fully encompass relativistic effects.
  - **QFT**
    - Fully compatible with relativity, handling relativistic particles and interactions at high energies.
    - For example, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) describes electromagnetic interactions within a relativistic quantum field framework.

**5. Application Areas**
  - **QM**
    - Mainly applied in atomic physics, molecular physics, condensed matter physics, quantum information, etc.
    - Describes the electronic structure and energy levels within atoms, molecules, and solids.
  - **QFT**
    - Primarily applied in high-energy physics, particle physics, and cosmology.
    - Describes the fundamental particles and forces, such as the electromagnetic force, strong force, and weak force.
